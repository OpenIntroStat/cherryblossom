This package contains data from the [Cherry Blossom
Run](http://www.cherryblossom.org/), which is an annual road race that
takes place in Washington, DC. All data come from the [Cherry Blossom
Race Results](http://www.cherryblossom.org/aboutus/results.php) page.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cherryblossom from GitHub
with:

``` r
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("OpenIntroStat/cherryblossom")
```

Once the package is on CRAN, you can install the released version of
cherryblossom from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cherryblossom")
```

## Usage

The datasets from this package can be used in a teaching context for
data visualization and data manipulation exercises. The columns of the
datasets from various years are not consistent, they’re provided in the
same format the Cherry Blossom run organizers release the data.

## cherryblossom and openintro

The datasets from this package are used in
[OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/) textbooks and other resources.
These datasets originally lived in the
[**openintro**](http://openintrostat.github.io/openintro/) package, up
until openintro 2.0.0. The motivation for extracting these datasets out
of the openintro package was to create a new package where we can
continue to add more data from the Cherry Blossom race results. For
those looking for a seamless experience with OpenIntro resources, note
that the contents of this package will be loaded along with the
openintro package as well, so that you can run `library(openintro)` and
use the datasets from cherryblossom.

## Questions, bugs, feature requests

You can file an issue to get help, report a bug, or make a feature
request.

When filing an issue to get help or report a bug, please make a minimal
**repr**oducible **ex**ample using the
[reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. If you haven’t heard of
or used reprex before, you’re in for a treat\! See
[here](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) for additional reprex pointers.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull
requests](https://github.com/openintrostat/cherryblossom/issues) to make
sure the bug hasn’t been reported and/or already fixed in the
development version. By default, the search will be pre-populated with
`is:issue is:open`. You can [edit the
qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)
(e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. For example, you’d simply remove
`is:open` to search *all* issues in the repo, open or closed.
