This package contains data from the Cherry Blossom Run, which is an annual road race that takes place in Washington, DC.
All data come from the [Chery Blossom Race Results](http://www.cherryblossom.org/aboutus/results.php) page.

## cherryblossom and openintro

The datasets from this package are used in [OpenIntro]() textbooks and other  resources.
These datasets originally lived in the [**openintro**]() package, up until openintro 2.0.0.
The motivation for extracting these datasets out of the openintro package was to create a new package where we can continue to add more data from the Cherry Blossom race results.
For those looking for a seamless experience with OpenIntro resources, note that the contents of this package will be loaded along with the openintro package as well, so that you can run `library(openintro)` and use the datasets from cherryblossom.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cherryblossom from GitHub with:

```r
#install.packages("devtools")
library(devtools)
install_github("OpenIntroStat/cherryblossom")
```

Once the package is on CRAN, you can install the released version of cherryblossom from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("cherryblossom")
```

## Usage

The datasets from this package can be used in a teaching context for data visualisation and data manipulation exercises. The columns of the datasets from various years are not consistent, they're provided in the same format the Cherry Blossom run organisers release the data.

## Questions, bugs, feature requests

You can file an issue to get help, report a bug, or make a feature request.

When filing an issue to get help or report a bug, please make a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the  [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 
If you haven't heard of or used reprex before, you're in for a treat! 
Seriously, reprex will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). 
For additional reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com//issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. 
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/)  (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. 
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.
